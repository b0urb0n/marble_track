# Marble Track

Each segment of track is 180mm long, 30mm high, and 28mm wide.  On the flat face of each segment are two 9mm-wide, 3.5mm-deep holes to receive a 8mm x 3mm cylindrical magnet and some glue.  The magnets I chose for this project are cylindrical 5mm x 3mm.  My kids play with them on a magnetic whiteboard.
